# Local development
To set up a local coding environment with the necessary libraries, use pip install as shown below (make sure you have Python version 3.7 or higher):

```
pip install streamlit openai langchain pandas tabulate
```
# Cloud development
In addition to using a local computer to develop apps, you can deploy them on the cloud using Streamlit Community Cloud. You can use the Streamlit app template to do this (read more [here]( https://blog.streamlit.io/streamlit-app-starter-kit-how-to-build-apps-faster/ ).

Next, add the following Python libraries to the requirements.txt file:

```
streamlit
openai
langchain
pandas
tabulate
```
